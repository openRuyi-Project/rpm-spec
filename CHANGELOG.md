# Changelog

All notable changes to `rpm-spec` are documented here.

The format roughly follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/),
and this crate adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) once
it reaches `0.1.0`.

## Unreleased

### Added

- `%changelog` sections preserve standalone macro statements such as
  `%autochangelog` and `%{?autochangelog}` as ordered AST items.

### Changed

- **Breaking (pre-1.0):** `Section::Changelog::entries` is replaced by
  `items: Vec<ChangelogItem<T>>` so dated entries and macro statements retain
  their source order.

## 0.4.1

### Fixed

- `parse_branch_head` now decodes `%%` escapes in `%ifarch` / `%ifos` /
  `%if` head tokens by routing each token through `parse_body_as_text`.
  Previously the raw lexeme (e.g. `%%{ix86}`) was kept as a single
  `TextSegment::Literal`; the pretty-printer's `print_literal_escaped`
  then re-escaped every `%`, emitting `%%%%{ix86}`. Each successive
  `parse → print` cycle doubled the escape (`%%%%%%%%{ix86}`, …),
  corrupting any spec formatted more than once with `format
  --in-place`. Regression tests live in `tests/ifarch_macro_escape.rs`.
- The pretty-printer now strips leading ` ` / `\t` from the first
  literal segment of every shell-body and text-body line, making the
  printer the sole source of indentation. Previously, lines captured
  by the parser with their original whitespace (typical for sections
  nested under `%if`, e.g. `%if … / %post / %systemd_post foo.service
  / %endif`) caused `parse → print(indent=N)` cycles to cumulatively
  double the indent on every pass. Applies to `%description`, `%prep`,
  `%build`, `%install`, `%check`, `%clean`, `%verify`, `%sepolicy`,
  and all scriptlet/trigger bodies. Regression tests in
  `tests/scriptlet_indent.rs`.

### Changed

- Internal cleanup: dropped a redundant `as usize` cast in
  `parser::section`'s rewind path (clippy `unnecessary_cast`).

## 0.4.0

### Added

- `ExprAst::NumericConcat { parts, data }` plus `ConcatPart::{Literal,
  Macro}` model the RPM idiom `0%{?el8}` — a literal digit-string glued
  to one or more `%{…}` macro references without intervening
  whitespace. Single-atom inputs are still emitted as the canonical
  `Integer` / `Macro` variants. Smart constructors `ConcatPart::literal`
  / `ConcatPart::macro_ref` are generic over `T: Default`. A
  `MAX_CONCAT_PARTS = 64` cap bounds memory on adversarial input.
- `ShellConditional<T>`, `ShellCondBranch<T>`, `ShellCondElse<T>` —
  structural surface of `%if` / `%elif*` / `%else` / `%endif` blocks
  detected inside a `ShellBody<T>`. Directive lines remain in
  `ShellBody::lines` as plain text (back-compat); the new
  `ShellBody::conditionals` field carries the parsed branches. Each
  type is `#[non_exhaustive]` with a `pub fn new(...)` constructor so
  external crates can build instances.
- `BuiltinMacro::With` / `BuiltinMacro::Without` plus
  `parse_bcond_verbatim` helper — first-class structural representation
  of `%{with foo}` / `%{without foo}` macros (was previously absorbed
  into the generic macro-reference path). Enables matrix-expand
  consumers to enumerate `--with`/`--without` flags without a separate
  bcond scan.

### Changed

- **Breaking (pre-1.0):** `ShellBody` is now generic — `ShellBody<T = ()>`.
  Most direct construction sites continue to compile because `T = ()`
  is the default and inference resolves it from the surrounding
  `Section<()>` context, but any code that named `ShellBody` as a
  concrete type (e.g. `fn foo(b: &ShellBody)`) now needs `&ShellBody<()>`
  or to be itself generic over `T`. Similarly `Scriptlet<T>`,
  `Trigger<T>`, `FileTrigger<T>`, and `Section::{BuildScript, Verify,
  Sepolicy}` now embed `body: ShellBody<T>` instead of `body: ShellBody`.
  `parse_str_with_spans` still produces `ShellBody<Span>` and
  `parse_str` still produces `ShellBody<()>` via the existing strip
  pipeline.
- New diagnostic emissions inside shell-body `%if` scanning: unterminated
  `%if` → `E_UNTERMINATED_CONDITIONAL`, repeated `%else` →
  `W_MULTIPLE_ELSE`, `%elif` after `%else` → `W_ELIF_AFTER_ELSE`. These
  cases were previously silent.
- `MAX_SHELL_COND_DEPTH = 64` DoS guard on nested `%if` blocks inside a
  shell body, with a single rate-limited warning when the limit is hit.

### Fixed

- `parse_section` and the shell-body collector now rewind correctly
  when a section header (`%post`, `%postun`, …) appears inside an open
  `%if`. Previously the shell-body pass greedily consumed the `%if`,
  hit the next section header, and emitted a spurious "unterminated
  `%if` inside shell body" error. The `%if … %post -p … %postun -p …
  %endif` idiom (dominant in real specs) now parses cleanly with the
  conditional wrapping the subsequent sections.
- `patch_last_branch_end` now threads the triggering directive's own
  `(end_line, end_column)` into the patched branch span instead of
  reusing the original `%if` head's single-line range. Downstream
  consumers that derive line ranges from `(start_line..=end_line)` now
  see the real body extent.
- `parse_concat_or_single` no longer has a dead `parts.is_empty()`
  branch — the caller's dispatch already guarantees ≥1 byte is
  consumed; the runtime check has been replaced with a `debug_assert!`.

## 0.3.4

### Fixed

- `span_for_line` now uses **byte** offsets for both `start_column` and
  `end_column`, matching the `Span` documented convention and
  `nom_locate::get_column()`. Previously `end_column` was computed from
  `chars().count()`, which under-counted on lines containing multibyte
  UTF-8 (e.g. a Cyrillic `Summary:` value or non-ASCII author names in
  `%changelog`) and misaligned the `codespan` underline.
- `is_indented_nonblank_line` (formerly
  `line_looks_like_body_continuation`) collapsed to a single
  `!trimmed.is_empty() && indented` check. The previous shape held
  unreachable `starts_with('-')` / `starts_with('*')` arms masked by a
  trailing `!trimmed.is_empty()`.

### Added

- `span_for_line` is now re-exported from `parser::*` (was reachable
  only via `parser::input::span_for_line` despite being `pub`). External
  sub-parsers building diagnostic spans can use it without reaching
  into the `input` module.
- Regression unit tests for macro-bearing subpackage names in
  `%files -n %{macro}-suffix` (`parser/files.rs`) and
  `%post -n %{macro}-suffix` (`parser/scriptlet.rs`).
- Unit tests for `span_for_line` covering ASCII byte columns, UTF-8
  byte (not char) columns, and the no-trailing-newline guarantee.

## 0.3.3

### Fixed

- Diagnostic spans for `W_LINE_NOT_RECOGNIZED`,
  `W_LINE_NOT_RECOGNIZED_IN_FILES`, and `W_LINE_NOT_RECOGNIZED_IN_PACKAGE`
  no longer extend past the end of the offending line. Previously the
  span included the trailing newline, which `codespan` rendered as a
  multi-line carat reaching into the unrelated next physical line.
- Section header subpackage arguments (`%description -n …`,
  `%package -n …`, `%files -n …`, `%verify -n …`, `%sepolicy -n …`,
  scriptlet headers) now accept macro references such as
  `%description -n %{shortname}-sub1`. The previous ident-only token
  parser silently dropped the macro segment.
- Suppress spurious `W_UNEXPECTED_LINE_IN_CHANGELOG` (`rpmspec/W0023`)
  on indented body lines inside `%changelog` entries. Real-world
  changelog bodies often contain bullet continuations like
  ` * release notes` or `  - url`, which the previous logic misread
  as malformed entry headers because it stripped leading whitespace
  before probing for `*`.

## 0.3.2

### Fixed

- Suppress spurious `W_UNTERMINATED_MACRO` (`rpmspec/W0004`) on real-world
  spec lines that open a `%{?macro:` body and close it many lines later
  (e.g. the `%{?ldconfig: %post -n libgcc -p <lua> … }` idiom in
  `gcc.spec`). The shell-body parser sees only one physical line at a
  time, so the legitimate cross-line conditional body would otherwise
  surface as an unterminated-macro warning with a misleading span.

## 0.3.1

### Fixed

- Multi-dep preamble lines (`BuildRequires: a, b, c`,
  `Requires: x, y >= 1.0`, and every other dep-bearing tag) now carry a
  distinct per-atom `Span` on each split `SpecItem::Preamble`. Previously
  every split item inherited the whole-line span, which broke
  source-byte slicing in hoist / dedup analyzers. Single-atom lines keep
  the whole-line span so autofixers can still remove the entire line via
  `body_span`. Affects: `Requires`, `BuildRequires`, `Provides`,
  `Conflicts`, `Obsoletes`, `Recommends`, `Suggests`, `Supplements`,
  `Enhances`, `BuildConflicts`, `OrderWithRequires`.

## 0.3.0

### Added

- Pretty-printer now emits a category-aware token stream consumable by
  syntax highlighters, ANSI colorizers, and IDE tooling:
  - `printer::TokenKind` — `#[non_exhaustive]` enum with 18 variants
    (preamble tags, section keywords, conditional keywords, macro
    flavours, `%if` operands/operators, comments, body text, modifier
    flags). `Plain` is the default for neutral whitespace and
    punctuation.
  - `printer::PrintWriter` — single-method trait
    `emit(&mut self, kind, text)`. Documented as infallible / in-memory
    only; ANSI-style example included.
  - `impl PrintWriter for String` — preserves byte-identical output for
    existing `print` / `print_with` callers.
  - `printer::print_to(spec, cfg, &mut dyn PrintWriter)` — entry point
    for category-aware sinks.
- File directives (`%doc`, `%license`, `%attr`, `%defattr`, `%config`,
  `%verify`, `%dir`, `%ghost`, `%lang`, `%caps`, `%artifact`,
  `%missingok`) classified as `MacroRef`; `%files` and scriptlet /
  trigger / file-trigger keywords as `SectionKeyword`.
- `text::print_body_literal_escaped` helper centralises the `%` → `%%`
  body-line escape used by changelog, description, and shell-body
  rendering.
- New tests: `classifies_specific_token_kinds`,
  `statement_emits_atomic_macro_ref_chunk`,
  `consecutive_sections_separated_by_single_blank_line`, plus
  `classified_writer_concatenates_to_plain_print` /
  `classified_writer_emits_at_least_one_semantic_token` round-trip
  guards.

### Changed

- Crate-level doc (`src/lib.rs`) rewritten — removed pre-alpha / stub
  language and added a runnable quick-start example.

## 0.2.0

### Added

- Structured parser for `%if` / `%elif` expressions (`ast::expr::ExprAst`
  + `BinOp`). Recognises integer/string/macro/identifier primaries,
  parenthesised sub-expressions, unary `!`, and binary `||`, `&&`, `==`,
  `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=` with conventional precedence. Every node
  carries a span when produced by the span-aware parser.
- New `CondExpr::Parsed(Box<ExprAst<T>>)` variant — populated when the
  full expression head fits the modelled grammar. Arithmetic
  (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) and other unmodelled constructs continue to land
  in `CondExpr::Raw` and round-trip bit-identically.
- Recursion-depth guard (`MAX_DEPTH = 128`) protects the expression
  parser from adversarial input like `!!…!!1` or `(((…)))`.
- Three roundtrip tests (`parsed_expressions_roundtrip`,
  `parsed_elif_expression_roundtrips`, `unmodelled_expr_falls_back_to_raw`)
  alongside expanded expression-parser unit coverage.

### Changed

- **BREAKING:** `CondExpr` gained a type parameter (`CondExpr<T = ()>`)
  so that `Parsed` can carry per-node spans. The default `T = ()` keeps
  most usages compiling, but downstream code that names the type
  parameter explicitly, implements traits over the enum, or destructures
  the previously-monomorphic shape needs to be adjusted.
- `parser::expr::parse_expression` is `pub(crate)` — the structured
  parser is reachable only via the conditional path.

## 0.1.0

### Added

- Public `printer::FEDORA_PREAMBLE_VALUE_COLUMN` constant for the
  default preamble value alignment column (was a magic `16`).
- Stable diagnostic codes (`rpmspec/E####` / `rpmspec/W####`) attached
  to every parser warning/error via `Diagnostic::code`.
- `tracing` instrumentation under the optional `tracing` feature on
  `parse_section`, `parse_preamble_line`, `push_diagnostic` and the
  public entry points.
- Range warnings: file modes outside `0..=0o7777` (`rpmspec/W0018`)
  and changelog dates with implausible day/year
  (`rpmspec/W0025`).
- Integration test suite covering CRLF, deeply-nested rich deps,
  large-input stress, non-ASCII identifiers, mode-boundary warnings,
  and multi-line continuations.

### Changed

- **BREAKING** (pre-0.1, no published crate yet): `ParseError` reduced
  from 4 variants to 1 (`Io`). The removed variants (`Syntax`,
  `UnterminatedConditional`, `InvalidSection`) were never produced by
  the current entry points — every recoverable issue is reported via
  `Diagnostic`. The remaining `Io` variant is reserved for future
  `parse_reader` / `parse_file` entry points. Because the enum is
  `#[non_exhaustive]`, downstream code must already include a wildcard
  arm.
- Removed the `pretty` workspace dependency (it was declared but
  never used by the simple-string-builder printer).
- Reduced `N×clone` in `build_preamble_items` for multi-dep preamble
  lines (`Requires: foo bar baz`). The common single-dep case now
  performs **zero** clones.
- `printer/util.rs` consolidates the `print_subpkg` helper that was
  previously duplicated verbatim in three printer sub-modules.
- `W_MALFORMED_CHANGELOG_HEADER` (`rpmspec/W0023`) no longer fires on
  implausible day/year. Those now produce `W_IMPLAUSIBLE_CHANGELOG_DATE`
  (`rpmspec/W0025`). Downstream consumers matching on diagnostic codes
  must add the new code to their handler.
- `%attr` / `%defattr` numeric mode detection rejects tokens
  containing digits `8` or `9` up front (treated as user/group names),
  rather than falling through `from_str_radix` failure.

### Fixed

- Lossy `.map_err(|_| ...)` calls in `parser/changelog.rs` that
  collapsed `nom::Err::Failure` to `Error` and lost source spans.
- `parser/util.rs::logical_line` continuation-detection logic
  rewritten with a single bool flag for clarity.
- Stale design-narrative comment in
  `printer/macros.rs::print_body_with_continuations`.
